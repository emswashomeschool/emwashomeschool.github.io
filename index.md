    Note for Microsoft o365 education school eligibility reviewers:
    <br/><br/>
  We are a homeschooling family which would like very much to be able to take advantage of capabilities available only through O365 education.
  These specifically include Minecraft education and the student-oriented capabilities of teams.
    <br/><br/>
    We are not seeking freebies -- If there were a way to separately access these capabilities, we would be delighted to pay those fees.
    We are licensees of o365 family and minecraft on many platforms.  Our IT coordinator uses o365 and Teams extensively at work, and is also an MSDN subscriber.
    <br/><br/>
    The office 365 education pilot for homeschoolers which was announced in 2016 has apparently been full since 2016.  Meanwhile, our student is three years older.
    <br/><br/>
    Thank you for your consideration!
